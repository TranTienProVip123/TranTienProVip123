Hi, I'm Tien Nguyen 👋👨‍💻

I’m a passionate web developer with a solid background in ReactJS, NodeJS, and databases. I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.
During my four years at university, I led multiple project teams—planning, mentoring, and delivering high-quality web applications. Most of our projects achieved top scores (8–10), and these experiences shaped my leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving skills.
What sets me apart is not just technical knowledge, but a strong sense of ownership, quick adaptability, and unwavering dedication to every challenge I take on.
I bring with me time, youth, and a burning passion for technology—and I’m ready to invest them in projects that make a difference.
Let’s build something amazing together. 🚀
